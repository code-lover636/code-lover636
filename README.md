## 🔥 About Me
I am an 18 year old student👨🏻‍🎓 and programmer👨🏻‍💻 with about 2 years of programming experience👴🏻. You must be thiking 2 years is so short🤏 but take some time to go through my projects(repositories)📁 before making an impression on me🤝🏻. I will call myself ambitious and curious🕵🏻‍♂️. I am always waiting to try new areas of programming which will open door ways🚪 to greater opportunities. When it comes to programming💻, I'm interested in Web developing, Web Scrapping📈, APIs, GUI development... 

## 🏆Achievements
My greater achievements are yet to come. But I scored a centum for computer science in CBSE class 12 final exams.
